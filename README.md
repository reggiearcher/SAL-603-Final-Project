# SAL 603 Final Project: Injury Epidemiology 
Research Question: Are athletes more at risk of suffering a non-contact soft tissue injury during preseason compared to regular season? 
Compare injury rates across two time periods within a football season. 

This project will visually desribe injury incidence and its weekly effect on a football team. 

Injury Classifications 
Injury classifications are defined based on mechanism of injury and type of injury suffered. 
7 Injury Classification: 
	1) Non-contact soft tissue 
	2) Contact soft tissue 
	3) Concussion 
	4) Meniscus/ Labral Pathology 
	5) Fracture/ Dislocation 
	6) Overuse 
	7) Other

# This is my data file on injury classification
'injury_classification = data/injurydata.csv'

# Formulas 
Injury rate = number of injuries / athlete exposure(AE)

# Key Visualizations 

Visualizations 
	1) Line Graph Demonstrating weekly injury rates 
	2) Injury Classification Bar Graph 
	3) Time Loss Comparision By Player 

	This project will be a collaboration between myself and Jason Leslie
